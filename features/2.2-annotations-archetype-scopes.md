## Summary

Introduce built-in annotations in Koin Annotations to represent standard Android scope archetypes: `@ActivityScoped`, `@FragmentScoped`, and `@ViewModelScoped`. These serve as ergonomic and interoperable equivalents to Hilt’s annotations with the same names.

---

## Motivation

Koin users frequently use scopes tied to Android lifecycles. Currently, they must manually specify strings like `"ActivityScope"` via `@Scope("...")`.

Using consistent, named annotations:
- Clarifies intent
- Improves compatibility for developers migrating from Hilt
- Reduces boilerplate

---

## Proposed Solution

Introduce the following annotations:

```kotlin
@Scope("ActivityScope")
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class ActivityScoped

@Scope("FragmentScope")
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class FragmentScoped

@Scope("ViewModelScope")
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class ViewModelScoped
```

These are thin wrappers over existing Koin `@Scope(...)` declarations, offering better readability and consistency. Those annotations are equivalent as `@Single` or `@Singleton`, as it's scope definition tag, allowing us have optional `@Inject` on constructor.

### Example:

```kotlin
@ActivityScoped
class SessionManager @Inject constructor()
```

or

```kotlin
@ActivityScoped
class SessionManager()
```

---

## Drawbacks & Alternatives

- Slight increase in annotation API surface
- Potential confusion if Hilt annotations are used simultaneously

Non realtistic Alternatives:
- Stick with `@Scope("...")` strings
- Rely on documentation and patterns rather than built-in archetypes

---

## Implementation Notes (optional)

- The annotations are syntactic sugar — the Koin processor interprets them identically to `@Scope("...")`
- Scope definitions must still be created via `activityScope()`, `fragmentScope()`, etc.

---

## Comparison to Hilt/Dagger

| Scope Target     | Koin Annotation           | Hilt/Dagger Annotation |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Activity         | `@ActivityScoped`         | `@ActivityScoped`       |
| Fragment         | `@FragmentScoped`         | `@FragmentScoped`       |
| ViewModel        | `@ViewModelScoped`        | `@ViewModelScoped`      |

---

## Future Considerations (optional)

- Could include Lint or compile-time checks for scope-definition consistency
- Might support additional scopes (e.g., `@ServiceScoped`, `@NavigationScoped`)
