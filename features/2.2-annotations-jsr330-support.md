## Summary

Allow usage of standard JSR-330 annotations like `@javax.inject.Inject` and `@javax.inject.Singleton` in Koin Annotations. This helps align with existing Java DI practices and improves portability for users migrating from Dagger or Guice.

---

## Motivation

Developers familiar with JSR-330 annotations expect to use `@Inject` and `@Singleton`. Supporting these annotations lowers the learning curve and makes projects more portable or interoperable across DI frameworks.

---

## Proposed Solution

- Extend the Koin Annotation KSP processor to recognize:
  - `@javax.inject.Inject` on constructors
  - `@javax.inject.Singleton` as equivalent to Koin’s `@Single`
- When encountered, these annotations will be mapped internally to their Koin equivalents during compile-time processing.

Example:

```kotlin
@Singleton
class MyRepository @Inject constructor(private val dao: Dao)
```

or


```kotlin
@Singleton
class MyRepository(private val dao: Dao)
```

Would be processed as if:

```kotlin
@Single
class MyRepository constructor(private val dao: Dao)
```

Note: `@Inject` cannot be applied to classes directly — only to constructors, methods, or fields. `@Inject` can be optional, if there is a scope annotation (like `@Singleton`, `@Single`, ...), as we can take the default first constructor.

---

## Drawbacks & Alternatives

- Adds implicit behavior: could confuse users if `@Singleton` behaves differently than in other frameworks.
- Users may mix annotation styles (Koin vs. JSR-330), leading to inconsistent codebases.
- An alternative is to require Koin-specific annotations for full clarity.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Needs internal mapping and processor changes in Koin Annotations module.
- Treat unscoped `@Inject` classes as `@Factory` behavior by default (optional).
- Support both:
  - Explicit `@Inject` on constructor (JSR-330 style)
  - No annotation if the class has a **single public constructor** (Koin ergonomic style)

This dual approach gives users flexibility and preserves Koin's simplicity while supporting JSR-330 compliance where needed.

---

## Comparison to Hilt/Dagger

In Dagger/Hilt:

- `@Inject` on an **unscoped** class results in a **new instance each time** it's injected (factory-like).
- `@Singleton` scopes it as a singleton.
- There's **no `@Factory` annotation** — factory is the default when no scope is applied.

| Behavior           | Koin                     | Hilt/Dagger                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Singleton          | `@Single`                | `@Singleton`                   |
| Factory (new each time) | `@Factory`            | No scope annotation at all     |
| Custom Scopes      | `@Scope("ActivityScope")` | `@ActivityScoped`, etc.        |
