KFIP - Koin Features & Improvements Proposals
--

Starting from [Koin](https://insert-koin.io) 4.x, all significant changes to the framework will pass through this repository 
for an initial review of the design before implementation.

> This repository is inspired from Kotlin KEEP and Ktor KLIP initiatives
> 
> The goal of this process is to promote transparency and collaboration in the development of the framework, as in the 
> spirit of the [Request of Comments (RFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) process developed by the 
> [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force).

## Proposals

* New proposals are submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/KFIP/pulls).
* When proposals are implemented, the corresponding design documents are merged into this repository and stored in a [proposals](proposals) directory.

## Contributing

We are always interested in new ideas for improving Koin. Not every idea needs to be reviewed here, nor do we expect 
submissions for the changes that do warrant consideration.

Enhancements/features usually go through the following informal stages:
- Discussion of an idea.
- Collection of use-cases.
- Design proposal and prototype implementation.
- Experimental support in the framework.
- Further refinement and stable release.

Generally, all that's required is [reaching us on #koin-contributors](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/koin-contributors), or submitting [an issue on Github Issue](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin).

If you're more interested in making major contributions to the framework, then here is the place where you can submit 
your proposals.

To submit a proposal:

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the `template.md` into the [proposals](proposals) directory under an appropriate filename.
3. Fill in all the relevant details for the proposal, as described in the template.
4. Create a pull request with the new proposal.
5. Wait for a review and the acceptance of your proposal.

After a proposal is accepted, it will be ready to be implemented into Koin.
